Introduction\\nI\\nn order to survive the present and future economic and environmental challenges facing air transportation,\\naviation design may neet to expand its focus beyond today’s conventional “wing-body-tail” aircraft and\\ninvestigate more advanced and eﬃcient vehicle concepts. The ability to design unconventional aircraft to\\nimprove mobility and air transport eﬃciency is of paramount importance and is expected to deliver additional\\nbeneﬁts, such as reduced ﬂeet fuel costs, minimized environmental impact, and improved mission capabilities.\\nHowever, traditional design methods rely on the accumulated experience of the designer and the availabil-\\nity of data and are not necessarily well suited for unconventional concepts. Test data and design experience\\nare inherently limited for unconventional aircraft; thus there is a strong need to incorporate more sophis-\\nticated computational models and methods — in particular, physics-based Multidisciplinary Analysis and\\nOptimization (MDAO) — into current and future design practices. To address this need, NASA’s Funda-\\nmental Aeronautics Program has undertaken the development of MDAO technologies.

Users of OpenMDAO will beneﬁt from having access to the source code; however, open\\nsource licensing has other beneﬁts as well. Users can contribute enhancements to the core framework, and\\nengineering components can be contributed to the general community as well. The mission of OpenMDAO is\\nto advance the science of MDAO by promoting collaboration and cooperation among industry, government,\\nand academia through the use of open source tools.\\nII. The Open Source Development Process\\nThe OpenMDAO project is managed through a central website, http://OpenMDAO.org. This website\\nhosts the OpenMDAO discussion forums as well as the Software Conﬁguration Management system. It also\\nprovides downloads for all oﬃcial OpenMDAO release versions. Lastly, OpenMDAO.org is home to all of\\nthe OpenMDAO documentation. OpenMDAO.org was set up to encourage outside development and provide\\nconvenient access to support resources for users.\\nFigure 1: Lifecycle of an OpenMDAO ticket.\\nThe OpenMDAO project uses the software con-\\nﬁguation managment tool Trac. 2 OpenMDAO’s\\nTrac server can be accessed from the main project\\nwebsite at http://OpenMDAO.org. Registration is\\nopen to anyone with an email address. Since its ini-\\ntial development, the OpenMDAO project has fol-\\nlowed formal methods of software veriﬁcation and\\nvalidation. The process began with the gathering\\nof over 600 requirements, both functional and non-\\nfunctional, spanning both the framework and the de-\\nsign analysis tools. The OpenMDAO Software Re-\\nquirements Speciﬁcation documents this work. 3 A\\ngroup of discipline experts inspected and prioritized\\nthese requirements, and 207 were identiﬁed as hav-\\ning a direct impact on the framework. Each of these\\n207 requirements is cataloged in the project’s soft-\\nware conﬁguration management system on Open-\\nMDAO.org. Every code submission is ultimately\\ntraceable to a requirement, a set of requirements,\\nor a new feature request.\\nA. Code Contribution\\nExternal development of OpenMDAO capabilities\\nfalls under two categories:\\n1. OpenMDAO plugin development\\n2. Core framework development\\nIn the ﬁrst case, developing OpenMDAO plug-\\nins, new capabilities are added to OpenMDAO by\\nmeans of external code modules which can be used\\nwithin an analysis. These code modules are usu-\\nally distributed by the people who develop them,\\nseparate from the OpenMDAO framework. Plugin\\ndevelopment is essentially independent from OpenMDAO development since the code is not contributed back\\nto the project.\\nIn the second case, core framework development, new modules are added and old modules are updated\\nwithin the framework itself. In general, these types of code contributions can be further divided into two sub-\\n2 of 12\\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'),\n",

In either case, the new code is contributed back to the OpenMDAO\\nproject and gets integrated into an oﬃcial software release.\\nUsers enter tickets into the Trac system, classifying them appropriately as enhancements or bugs. The\\nOpenMDAO development team uses Trac to manage their own work, but Trac also manages code contribu-\\ntions from outside developers. Once a new ticket has been created, it progresses through a series of stages\\n(states) in its lifecycle as it is worked on, completed, and integrated into the main code base. Figure 1 shows\\nthis lifecycle and illustrates how a ticket progresses. If an outside developer chooses to work on a particular\\nticket, he would use Trac to assign it to himself and then transition the ticket to a working state. This lets\\neveryone else know that someone is working on the ticket and prevents duplication of eﬀort. Once the work\\nis completed, the developer assigned to the ticket moves it to the ready merge state, and a merge request\\ngets submitted on the OpenMDAO launchpad site. This lets the development team know that the work is\\ncomplete and ready to be reviewed. Once the new code passes review, the development team merges it into\\nthe main code base; then the ticket is moved to the merged state. At this point, work on that particular\\nticket is considered complete.\\nB. Open Source Licensing\\nOpenMDAO is licensed under the NASA Open Source Agreement (NOSA). NOSA is a permissive open\\nsource license which is based on the Mozilla Public License (MPL). Permissive open source licenses, also\\ncalled non-viral licenses, provide a good balance between protecting the integrity of the core framework and\\nallowing for integration with commercial and proprietary plugins. 1\\nUnder NOSA, OpenMDAO can be freely distributed and used. If changes are made to any of the modules\\ndelivered as part of OpenMDAO, the resulting new modules retain the NOSA license. They must either be\\ncontributed back to the OpenMDAO development community or be provided as stand-alone modules licensed\\nunder NOSA. However, plugin development is not at all impacted by NOSA. Commercial plugins can be\\ndeveloped without needing to be licensed as open source software. Plugins will be distributed completely\\nseparate from OpenMDAO itself, so users would ﬁrst acquire OpenMDAO and then acquire the speciﬁc\\nplugin they want. Plugins are also an appropriate development method when users wish to develop their\\nown capabilities and distribute them internally within their own company. These proprietary plugins also\\nneed not be licensed as open source projects.\\nC. Testing\\nFigure 2: Testing results from the Buildbot tool.\\nTesting is an essential development tool for the\\nOpenMDAO project. An extensive test suite of over\\n300 tests is included with every OpenMDAO distri-\\nbution and development branch. Users can run the\\ntest suite to ensure that their OpenMDAO instal-\\nlation is functioning properly, and developers can\\nuse the tests to ensure that any changes they have\\nmade to the code did not have any unintended side\\neﬀects. External code contributions must be accom-\\npanied by a set of new or updated unit tests before\\nthe external code will be approved for integration\\ninto the main development code base.\\nThe OpenMDAO framework supports multiple\\nplatforms — Linux, Windows, Mac OS X — so the\\ntest suite must be executed on each of these before changes can be committed to the code repository.\\nHowever, for each of these platforms there are variations in the operating system series and version that\\nmay also require testing (e.g, Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows Server 2000, etc.). This adds up to quite\\na few systems where both the installation and execution of OpenMDAO must be tested, so test automation\\nis necessary. A continuous integration tool called Buildbot 4 has proved to be very useful for this. Buildbot\\ncan create servers, known as build slaves, which can be commanded to install OpenMDAO, run the test\\nsuite, and post the results to another server hosting a build master. The build master monitors the code\\nrepository for new code then commits and launches tests on the build slaves as new code is introduced. A\\ntypical report is shown in Fig. 2.\\n3 of 12\\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'),\n",

Buildbot results\\nfrom the latest builds are publicly available at http://www.openmdao.org/buildbot.\\nD. Documentation and Training\\nIt is absolutely critical to have strong documentation for an open source project, particularly when it is a\\ncomplex engineering tool like a framework. In many cases, the most critical parts of the documentation are\\nthe simplest – the instructions that guide a new user through installation and use of the most commonly\\nused functions. This kind of documentation is often the most overlooked by developers. 5 The OpenMDAO\\nteam has given a high priority to documentation and is committed to maintaining both an extensive User\\nGuide and Developer Guide for the framework.\\nFigure 3: The OpenMDAO User Guide.\\nThe User Guide (Fig. 3) contains documentation\\nfor anyone who wants to build and execute models\\nin OpenMDAO, starting with instructions for in-\\nstalling the framework on the supported platforms.\\nThe team carefully considered several problems that\\ncould be used as examples in a set of tutorials that\\nrange from the simplest of problems – unconstrained\\noptimization of a simple function over two design\\nvariables – to a much more complicated automotive\\ndrivetrain design problem. The tutorials will expand\\nas more capability is added to the framework and as\\nmore problems are contributed by the community.\\nThe User Guide also contains a complete guide to\\nOpenMDAO’s scripting interface. Patterned after\\nthe Pylons6 User Guide, this section details most of\\nOpenMDAO’s usable classes and functions, including those in the standard library, which are illustrated\\nwith inline examples. Additionally, the User Guide explains the process of wrapping external codes (written\\nin C, Fortran, etc.).\\nThe documentation text is written using a lightweight markup format called reStructuredText. For\\ndisplay, the reStructuredText is converted to HTML using the Sphinx 7 document generator. Sphinx can\\nautodocument the source code using the docstrings of each Python function and class. Additionally, one of\\nthe most useful features of Sphinx is the support for diﬀerent builders, such as the testdocs builder. With\\nthis builder (and a small amount of additional markup), all of the code snippets inside of the docs can be\\nautomatically tested when the unit tests are executed. This assures that the code examples presented in the\\ndocs will always be accurate and in sync with the framework development.\\nThe latest version of the documentation, as well as the documentation for previous releases, is always\\navailable on the OpenMDAO website. The documentation is included in the software conﬁguration man-\\nagement database, so it is tied directly to speciﬁc distributions and even speciﬁc development versions of\\nOpenMDAO. Just as with the testing, when outside contributions are made to OpenMDAO, they should be\\naccompanied with updated documentation.\\n4 of 12\\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'),\n",

Framework Capabilities\\nOpenMDAO version 0.1 has been released, and is avaiable for download from the project website. This is\\nan alpha version of OpenMDAO and a detailed description of the current framework capabilities is presented\\nbelow.\\nA. Infrastructure - Components, Drivers, Assemblies, and Sockets\\nIn OpenMDAO, a problem is represented by a system of objects called components. These objects have input\\nand output attributes and can perform some sort of calculation when they are executed. You can connect\\nthe inputs and outputs of one component to those of other components, allowing data to be passed between\\nthem. Figure 4 gives a conceptual view of what a simple Component might look like. This Component has\\ntwo inputs (a, b) and one output (c). The calculation that it performs is to add the two inputs to produce\\nthe output. In a multidisciplinary analysis, a Component represents a unit of computational work in the\\nFigure 4: Conceptual view of a simple Component.\\nframework and could be considered to be a single discipline or analysis. Some componentswill be written\\npurely in Python code. Native Python components are very easy to construct and provide the ability for\\nusers to rapidly implement new analysis tools. Other components may be comprised of a Python wrapper\\nfor a code written in another language, such as Fortran, C, or C++.\\nWrapped components are often used when integrating legacy engineering tools into OpenMDAO as\\ncomponents. However, when computation eﬃciency is necessary, it makes sense to take a pure Python\\ncomponent and convert it to a wrapped component using a small amount of compiled code representing\\nthe core engineering. In the OpenMDAO User Guide, a piston engine model is created as a pure Python\\ncomponent. Then that analysis is converted into a compiled executable written in C and wrapped in Python\\nto make a compiled component. The result of the complied component is a roughly 800% increase in\\ncomputation speed.\\nOpenMDAO uses Drivers to perform the following iterative processes: optimization, convergence, and\\ndesign of experiments (DOE). OpenMDAO currently provides a number of drivers:\\n1. CONMINdriver: A wrapper of the CONMIN optimizer, which performs a constrained minimization\\nusing a gradient-based algorithm\\n2. Genetic: A genetic algorithm optimizer based on the Pyevolve 8 package\\n3. DOEdriver: A DOE runner, which can execute any number of speciﬁc DOE types (Latin Hypercube,\\nFull Factorial)\\n4. BroydenSolver: A Newton-Rhapson solver with Broyden approximation to the Jacobian\\n5. SingleCritEI: An implementation of the Expected Improvement algorithm for locating valuable new\\ntraining points in adaptive sampling methods with a single objective\\nThe Assembly contains groups of components and drivers that compose an analysis. Figure 5 depicts\\nan assembly containing four components anda single driver. Both the Assembly and Driver classes are sub-\\nclasses of Component. This means that they can have their own inputs and outputs and can be included\\nin models with other components. This capability allows nested models to be created by having complex\\nsimulations contained within an assembly, i.e. a turbine enginesimulation in an Assembly which is used as\\na component in an aircraft simulation.\\n5 of 12\\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'),\n",

They are used by Components, Assemblies, and Drivers to provide a place where users\\ncan insert objects that meet a certain interface to perform some additional calculations. For example, a\\ncomponent calculating the drag on a wing might provide a socket to allow the user to insert a custom ﬂap\\ndrag calculation. In the example problem section, a Design Of Experiment (DOE) Driver uses a socket to\\nallow diﬀerent types of DOE to be used.\\nOpenMDAO supports both optional and mandatory sockets. An optional socket can be used when its\\nfunction is not necessary but will enhance the calculation somehow. If the user does not put anything in\\nan optional socket, the analysis simply continues without using it. A mandatory socket is required for the\\nexecution of a Component. If no object is inserted into a mandatory socket, then an error will be raised and\\nexecution cannot continue.\\nB. Variables and Data Passing\\nIn OpenMDAO, data is passed between components using I/O-traits. I/O-traits are variables that can be\\nconnected when an output of one component is required as an input of another component. Python is a\\nweakly typed language, so the Enthought Traits9 package was used to create a set of strongly typed variable\\nclasses. This means, for example, that an integer variable can only be assigned a value that is an integer,\\nand an exception will be raised for an attempt to assign it a string value. The OpenMDAO standard library\\nincludes several basic variable I/O-Trait types (Float, Int, Array, Enum, Str, Bool). Additionally, new data\\ntypes can be created, including those that are complex data objects. Any arbitrary Python object can be\\npassed as data between components using an appropriate I/O-Trait.\\nI/O-Traits have attributes. Floats and Ints have high and low attributes which specify the maximum\\nand minimum values respectively for that variable. Any attempt to assign a value outside of those limits\\nresults in an exception. All variables have a default value to which they can be reset.\\nOpenMDAO supports variables with explicitly deﬁned units using the Float or Array variable types. The\\nfollowing speciﬁc behavior is enforced when a variable with a deﬁned unit is connected to another framework\\nvariable. The system:\\n• Automatically converts a value passed from an output to an input with compatible units (e.g., “inch”\\nand “m”)\\n• Raises an exception when an attempt is made to pass a value from an output to an input that has\\nincompatible units (e.g., “kg” and “m”)\\n• Allows values to be passed between variables without units speciﬁed and variables with units; no unit\\nconversion occurs\\nNote that the unit checking and conversion only occur during data passing in the framework. A variable can\\nbe used internally in a component without incurring any additional computational overhead due to the unit\\ncapability. The unit conversion is based on the PhysicalQuantities class in Scientiﬁc Python 10 but modiﬁed\\nfor improved performance and ﬂexibility. The unit deﬁnitions also come from Scientiﬁc Python, although\\n6 of 12\\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'),\n",

A complete list of the default units library is included in the online\\ndocumentation. The list of units can also be extended by the user either at runtime or with a conﬁguration\\nﬁle.\\nC. WorkFlows and Iteration Hierarchy\\nMore intricate processes can be implemented in OpenMDAO using WorkFlows in the iteration hierarchy. A\\nWorkFlow is an object that determines execution order for a group of Components. Each driver contains a\\nsingle WorkFlow. For each iteration, a Driver will execute one pass through the WorkFlow, executing the\\ncomponents contained therein in the order the WorkFlow prescribes. Although in many cases a WorkFlow\\ncontains just Components, it can also contain Drivers. This allows nested iterative processes to be created.\\nFigure 6 shows an iteration hierarchy for a collaborative optimization problem with two disciplines.\\nFigure 6: Iteration hierarchy for collaborative optimization.\\nOpenMDAO also supports a speciﬁc subclass of WorkFlow, called DataFlow. A DataFlow infers the\\nexecution order of an analysis based on the variable connections between the components. For example, Fig.\\n7 shows a model with three connected components: A, B, and C. Since Component C relies on input from\\nComponent B, which in turn relies on input from Component A, the execution order clearly needs to be A,\\nB, C. OpenMDAO’s DataFlow determines this order so that the driver can execute these components in the\\nproper order.\\nFigure 7: Left: Data ﬂow for a simple problem. Right: Work ﬂow inferred automatically from data\\nﬂow.\\nIV.

In-\\nstead, the EI method evaluates the surrogate model\\nto ﬁnd the point with the best chance of improv-\\ning the predicted optimum, which is measured as\\nthe point with the highest value of EI. This point is\\nthen added as a new training point for the surrogate\\nmodel, and the process iterates until some stopping\\ncondition is reached. In this way, each successive training point is adaptively selected based on the current\\nknowledge of the model behavior and the training data. Computational time is not wasted evaluating the\\nmodel in places where its value is likely to be much higher than the current known minimum.\\nThe EI function (Eq. (2)) calculates an estimate of the improvement in the surrogate model’s prediction\\nof the optimum due to the addition of a given new training point. Speciﬁcally, the EI is a measure of the\\namount in objective value a given point has the potential to improve relative to the current best point.\\nAlso, EI is calculated in the same units as the objective function, so it’s value is directly comparable to the\\nobjective itself.12\\nEI(x) =\\n(\\ny∗ − µ(x)\\n)\\nΦ\\n(y∗ − µ(x)\\nσ(x)\\n)\\n+ σ(x)φ\\n(y∗ − µ(x)\\nσ(x)\\n)\\n(2)\\nIn Eq. (2), y∗ represents a given value for the optimum of the function. For this process, y∗ is calculated\\nby ﬁltering the current set of training data to ﬁnd the point with the lowest objective value. µ(x) and σ(x)\\nrepresent the mean and standard deviation of the surrogate model prediction at a given point, x. Φ( ·) and\\nφ(·) represent the standard normal density and the distribution functions respectively.\\nB. Implementation\\nFigure 9 shows the iteration hierarchy used in OpenMDAO to implement the single objective EI optimization.\\nWhen an analysis is run, the ﬁrst thing that happens is that the top level Driver, called driver, executes its\\nWorkFlow. For any simulation in OpenMDAO, the top level Driver is always named driver. The WorkFlow\\nof driver will execute DOE trainer and then iterate consecutively.

In this\\ncase, driver simply executes one time, and then it is done. This nesting of Drivers with individual WorkFlows\\nis how an iteration hierarchy is deﬁned within OpenMDAO.\\nFigure 9: Iteration hierarchy for the single objective EI optimization.\\nDOE trainer has a WorkFlow that contains just branin meta model. When DOE trainer runs, it it-\\neratively runs each point in the speciﬁc DOE on branin meta model. This allows the branin meta model\\ncomponent to collect a set of initial training data points. Jones suggests that for this problem a 21-point\\nLatin Hypercube DOE is suﬃcient to seed the surrogate model and bootstrap the adaptive sampling pro-\\ncess.11 DOE trainer is an instance of the DOEdriver class, which has a socket for a DOEgenerator. A\\nDOEgenerator provides the DOEdriver with non-dimensional values to assign to each parameter for a given\\ncase. In this example, a Latin Hypercube DOEgenerator is used, but other DOEgenerators could be be\\nsubstituted into the DOEdriver.\\nThe branin meta model component is an instance of the MetaModel class. This class provides generalized\\nmeta modeling capabilities to the OpenMDAO framework. It has two sockets, one for a particular surrogate\\nmodel generator and a second for the model that is being approximated. In this case, a Kriging surrogate\\nmodel generator was used along with a simple component implementing the Branin test problem. The\\nMetaModel component has two operating modes: training and prediction. When run in training mode,\\nMetamodel passes its given inputs down to the model in its socket and runs the model. Then it stores the\\noutputs from the model to use for generating a surrogate model later. When run in predict mode, MetaModel\\nwill check for any new training data and, if present, will generate a surrogate model for each model output\\nwith the data. Then it will make a prediction of the model outputs for the given inputs.\\nAfter DOE trainer ﬁnishes executing the full set of cases in its DOE, iterator is executed. The iterator\\nrepetitively executes its WorkFlow until a stopping condition (provided by the user) is satisﬁed. In the case\\nof an EI algorithm, a good choice of stopping condition is when the value of EI drops below some speciﬁed\\nproportion of the optimum. Another option would simply be to iterate until a speciﬁc number of iterations\\nhas been reached. Here, both stopping conditions are applied: iterator will iterate 30 times or until the value\\nof EI for the next case drops below .03 (about 10% of the optimum value), whichever occurs ﬁrst.\\nThe WorkFlow of iterate includes three components: ﬁlter, EI driver, and retrain. These three com-\\nponents comprise the core of the EI adaptive sampling algorithm. The ﬁlter is a ParetoFilter component,\\nwhich ﬁlters a given set of cases into Pareto-optimal cases and dominated cases.

Results\\nFigure 10 shows the iteration history of the EI algorithm as it moved toward completion. The initial set\\nof 21 DOE points is shown in brown. Each successive sample point shows as a color, ranging from pink\\nto yellow, indicating when (which iteration) it was selected. Pink indicates earlier iterations, and the color\\nprogressively transitions to yellow for the later iterations. There were 10 sample points taken, and then the\\niterations ended due to the value of EI dropping to below the stopping threshold. Including the initial DOE,\\nthere were a total of 31 sample points taken. The 10 EI-based sample points are highly clustered around\\neach of the three minima in the Branin function. However, the distribution of pink and yellow points is also\\nfairly even among all of the three minima. The algorithm would start sampling points around one minimum,\\nand when the EI around that one got too low, then it would move on to another one. Eﬀectively the EI\\nalgorithm was allotting equal amounts of sample points to each minimum. This is the proper behavior since\\neach minimum has equal values.\\nFigure 10: Iteration history of the EI algorithm. Branin function contours are displayed.

EI iteration points are colored from pink to yellow representing\\niteration count.\\nIt should be noted that the SingleCritEI driver class makes use of a genetic algorithm, internally, to ﬁnd\\nthe point with the maximum expected improvement. Since genetic algorithms are stochastic in nature, two\\nsuccessive runs of the EI algorithm will not necessarily result in the exact same sample point set.\\nAfter the EI process was completed, the branin meta model component was tested at each of the three\\nknown minima.

Conclusion\\nThe OpenMDAO framework is being developed to meet NASA’s MDAO needs, in particular, the need\\nto encapsulate more advanced MDAO processes and the need to allow the integration of higher-ﬁdelity tools\\ninto the design process. Leveraging the advantages of open source development, a process has been developed\\nto allow for the inclusion of code contributions from sources outside the core development team. Crucially,\\nOpenMDAO is licensed with a non-viral license, NOSA, which allows non-open and proprietary plugins to\\nbe integrated into the framework.\\nTo encourage the adoption of OpenMDAO by the widest possible audience, comprehensive software doc-\\numentation has been created for OpenMDAO. This documentation has been integrated into OpenMDAO’s\\ndevelopment repository so that it is version controlled with the rest of the code base. This ensures that\\ndocumentation for a speciﬁc OpenMDAO release, or even a particular OpenMDAO development revision, is\\nalways available. As the documentation is updated to reﬂect new capabilities and changes to the framework,\\nusers will still have access to older documentation for the version they are employing.\\n11 of 12\\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics'),\n",

The algorithm includes initialization from a DOE and a\\nnested iteration hierarchy that displays the versatility of the WorkFlow deﬁnition within OpenMDAO. Also\\ndisplayed is the ability to have the same component in multiple workﬂows. The Branin test problem can\\neasily be replaced with a real analysis component. In this way, OpenMDAO supports the development of\\nMDAO processes which can be deployed for use on multiple problems. This capability lets users build up a\\nlibrary of processes to pick from whenever an analysis demands MDAO techniques.\\nHaving developed this implementation, it would be trivial to swap out the component for the Branin test\\nproblem with a real analysis component and apply the same EI algorithm. Easily interchangeable components\\nsuch as this will permit the construction of MDAO tools and process libraries, whose features may be\\nindividually called and applied to analyses demanding speciﬁc MDAO techniques. In this way, OpenMDAO\\nwill continue to support process development for use in all phases of the design cycle from conception through\\nmanufacturing. The open source nature of the framework will facilitate developer interaction from academia,\\ngovernment, and industry while advancing the future state of MDAO through broad-based community\\nsupport and collaboration.\\nVI. Future Work\\nDevelopment of the OpenMDAO framework is ongoing. One major eﬀort for the next year will be the\\ndesign and implementation of a cross-platform Graphical User Interface (GUI) to provide an alternative to\\nthe Python scripting interface. Additional eﬀorts will include developing the ability to integrate component-\\nprovided analytical gradients into a framework-wide gradient calculation scheme, the continued development\\nof an Application Programming Interface (API) to interface with geometry objects, and some code opti-\\nmization to improve the eﬃciency of the framework infrastructure. Additionally, quite a few drivers and\\naerospace analysis components will be wrapped for use in OpenMDAO.\\nAcknowledgments\\nThis work is supported by the Subsonic Fixed Wing project under NASA’s Fundamental Aeronautics\\nProgram.\\nThanks goes to Damon Rousis, of the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory at the Georgia Institute\\nof Technology, for his support in developing the Expected Improvement algorithms and implementing them\\nwithin the OpenMDAO framework.\\nReferences\\n1Moore, K., Naylor, B., and Gray, J., “The Development of an Open-Source Framework for Multidisciplinary Analysis\\nand Optimization,” 10th AIAA/ISSMO Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization Conference, AIAA, Victoria, Canada,\\nAugust 2008, 2008-6069.\\n2“Trac,” http://trac.edgewall.org/.\\n3“NASA Fundamental Aeronautics Program Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (FAP MDAO) Software Re-\\nquirements Speciﬁcation,” January 2008.\\n4“Buildbot,” http://www.buildbot.com/.\\n5Fogel, C., Producing Open Source Software, O’Reilly, London, October 2005.\\n6“Pylons,” http://pylonshq.com/.\\n7“Sphinx,” http://sphinx.pocoo.org/.\\n8“Pyevolve,” http://pyevolve.sourceforge.net/.\\n9“Enthought Traits,” http://code.enthought.com/projects/traits/.\\n10“Scientiﬁc Python,” http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/plone/software/scientiﬁcpython/.\\n11Jones, D.
